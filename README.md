# PORTFOLIO

## About me
Hi. My name is Dominik Nowicki and i'm living in Poland.
I have recently embarked on a career change journey in order to become a Software Tester. 
This career path has interested me for quite a while, so I am excited to be given a chance to prove my skills.
In this portfolio I would like to share my testing knowledge and exhibit my technical skills, which I gained during the testing course I have completed and through self-learning.
I am determined to prove the skills I have already acquired and keep developing in this field. This is why I am now looking for a junior position in testing.

**My experience** 

Right now i'm active tester at uTest.
